Hi, I'm 17.

I work as a DDoS and Network engineer for SynthoHosting. 
I work with Linux networking, eBPF, mostly in Rust. I like to open-source my work, checkout BRA1L0R/hopper-rs

Checkout my electronics projects too. I've built a PoC real-time operating system for Cortex-M processors. 
I've also built an off-grid communication device with a custom pcb... for my girlfriend :)

When I'm not doing this I'm either sleeping or studying :')
