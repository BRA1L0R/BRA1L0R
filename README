-- Who I am --

Pietro, 18M, Italy (Rome)

-- What I do --

Checkout my electronics projects too. I've built a PoC real-time operating system for Cortex-M processors. 
I've also built an off-grid communication device with a custom pcb... for my girlfriend :)

When I'm not doing this I'm either sleeping or studying :')
