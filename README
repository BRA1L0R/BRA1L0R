-- Who I am --

Pietro, 17M, Italy (Rome)

-- What I do --

I work as a DDoS and Network engineer for SynthoHosting. I am also the core developer for the Minefence project.
I like to open-source my work, checkout BRA1L0R/hopper-rs <3

Checkout my electronics projects too. I've built a PoC real-time operating system for Cortex-M processors. 
I've also built an off-grid communication device with a custom pcb... for my girlfriend :)

When I'm not doing this I'm either sleeping or studying :')
